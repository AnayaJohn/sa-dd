<ol>
  <li style="font-weight: 700; font-size: 22px; color: white;">The Pinnacles</li>
      <p>It is a Two-hour drive from Perth. Located in the Nambung National Park, and formed 25,00 to 30,000 
        years ago, The Pinnacles is a mammoth collection of giant limestone pillars, some standing as high 
        as five metres (16.4 feet) tall. Throughout the centuries, coastal winds removed the surrounding 
        sand, leaving the pillars exposed to the elements. They are a truly humbling and majestic natural
        site, forcing perspective and our place in a vast history. One of the best ways to view the 
        Pinnacles is via a 4WD tour through the sand dunes.</p>

  <li style=" font-weight: 700; font-size: 22px;color: white;">Lake Hillier</li>
        <p>It is an Eight-hour drive from Perth. We love how nature can mess with us and create 
          spectacular oddities like a pink lake! Located on Middle Island near Esperance, Lake Hillier 
          is known for its baffling bubble-gum pink hue. Although it’s not the only pink lake in 
          Australia, it’s often considered the most vibrant. Its pink color is less accentuated when 
          viewed from the surface but it is very prominent from above. However, unlike other pink lakes 
          around the world, its water is still distinctively pink even when it is in a glass. Simply 
          magic. Enjoy a scenic and relaxing flight with Goldfields Air Services around Middle Island 
          to really experience the lake up from its best angle.  </p>

  <li style=" font-weight: 700; font-size: 22px;color: white;">Litchfield</li>
          <p>It is a Two-hour drive from Darwin. Litchfield National Park is filled with stunning 
            waterfalls and waterholes that are surrounded by monsoonal vine forests. The most popular 
            place to take a dip is Wangi Falls. Get a bird's-eye view with Litchfield Helicopter Flights 
            or learn about the local Indigenous connection to the site with Northern Territory Indigenous 
            Tours.</p>

  <li style="font-weight: 700; font-size: 22px;color: white;">Kings Canyon</li>
            <p>It is a Six-hour drive from Alice Springs. The towering red sandstone walls of Kings 
              Canyon are astonishing. The jagged red rock and smooth, steep stone of the canyon stretch 
              out across the desert. Kings Canyon can be explored from a helicopter or on the iconic 
              rim walk.</p>

  <li style="font-weight: 700; font-size: 22px;color: white;">Uluru and Kata Tjuta</li>
              <p>It is a Five-hour drive from Alice Springs. Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park is home 
                to two of the country’s most amazing natural monuments, Kata Tjuta and Uluru. Imbued 
                with spirituality and a rich Indigenous history, the heart of the Red Centre is a 
                must-see. Join a SEIT Outback tour to learn more about the cultural significance of this 
                incredible area from your guide.</p>

  <li style="font-weight: 700; font-size: 22px;color: white;">Wilpena Pound</li>
              <p>It is a Five-hour drive from Adelaide. Wilpena Pound in the Flinders Ranges is a huge, 
                sunken natural amphitheatre – a vast crater carved out of the desert, surrounded by jagged 
                mountains. Wilpena Pound covers eight times the area of Uluru. Take in the enormity of 
                this sunken natural amphitheatre on a scenic flight. </p>  

  <li style="font-weight: 700; font-size: 22px;color: white;">The Fairy Pools</li>
            <p>It is a Two-hour drive from Brisbane. The Fairy Pools, set within Noosa National Park on 
              Queensland's Sunshine Coast, are natural tidal pools surrounded by dark and dramatic 
              basalt rocks. The pools are home to a variety of coral and sponges that can be spotted 
              at low tide. Take a walk along the Coastal Track through the beautiful Noosa National 
              Park. </p>

  <li style="font-weight: 700; font-size: 22px; color: white;">Freycinet National Park</li>
              <p>It is a 2.5-hour drive from Hobart. Freycinet National Park in Tasmania is a 
                picturesque peninsular of towering, pink-hued granite mountains that surround 
                the white sands and calm, blue waters of Wineglass Bay. Simply relax on the miles 
                of white sand at the Friendly Beaches, follow the 90-minute walk to Wineglass Bay 
                lookout, or take a day-tour from Hobart, like a wonder-filled chartered cruise.</p>

  <li style="font-weight: 700; font-size: 22px; color: white;">The Great Ocean Road</li>
                <p>It is a 1.5-hour drive from Melbourne. The Great Ocean Road is packed with sweeping 
                  coastal views and ancient rock formations. Some of the most impressive sights along 
                  the way are Loch Ard Gorge, the iconic 12 Apostles, Gibson Steps and London Bridge. 
                  Simply set off on a road trip along one of Australia’s most spectacular coastlines, 
                  or if you're feeling like an adrenaline rush – why not take in the view while 
                  skydiving?</p>
