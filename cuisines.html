  <li style="font-weight: 700; font-size: 22px; color: white;">Chicken Parmigiana</li>
      <p>This classic Aussie chicken dish – with roots in Italian-American cooking – is a staple 
          offering on pretty much every pub menu in the country. Originally eggplant based (and these 
          are still available for vegetarians), it has evolved into a chicken schnitzel topped with 
          tomato sauce, melted cheese and, if you’re feeling fancy, prosciutto ham. This is typically 
          served with salad and chips, although there’s a split between those who think the chips 
          should be under the parmy and those who think they should be on the side.</p>

  <li style=" font-weight: 700; font-size: 22px;color: white;">Barbecued snags (aka sausages)</li>
        <p>It’s no surprise that Aussies love to grill, and nothing is more important to a good barbie 
            than a decent sausage – whether you’re at a mate’s place or at your local Bunnings for a 
            sausage sizzle. Traditional Australian sausages are usually pork or beef, but if you’re 
            feeling adventurous, there are other animals to sample. Wrap a slice of bread around your 
            snag and top it off with some fried onions and your favourite sauce. </p>

  <li style=" font-weight: 700; font-size: 22px;color: white;">Lamingtons</li>
          <p>Widely recognised as the ‘National Cake of Australia’ after the National Trust of 
              Queensland voted this sweet treat an Australian icon, named as it was after Lord 
              Lamington, a former Governor of Queensland.

            The lamington is a modest square-shaped sponge dipped in chocolate and coated with 
            desiccated coconut. Other variations include two layers and a cream or jam filling – 
            seen by many as a vital addition. They go perfectly with a nice cup of bush tea, or 
            maybe one of Melbourne’s world-famous coffees, and are available in all good bakeries 
            and cafes.
            
            Although the cake is thought to have been first served in Toowoomba, the national 
            success has seen it take off in cities across Australia. Kytons Bakery in Adelaide 
            is the current award holder for best lamington in Australia.</p>

  <li style="font-weight: 700; font-size: 22px;color: white;">Pavlova</li>
            <p>Both Australia and New Zealand lay claim to inventing this famous dessert, created 
                in honour of the Russian ballerina Anna Pavlova’s visit to Australasia in the 1920s. 
                As a truly Australian after-dinner sweet, the pavlova’s crispy meringue crust, light 
                fruit filling and whipped cream topping ensure it’s a family hit.
            
                Australian claims to the dish lay in a recipe written by a Perth hotel owner in 1935, 
                however recent research says that dish began life in Germany before evolving into its 
                current form in the United States.

                Regardless of where it was created, today’s Australian offerings are perfect for those 
                with a sweet tooth.</p>

  <li style="font-weight: 700; font-size: 22px;color: white;">Meat Pies</li>
              <p>You may think that a pie’s a pie, available in any flavour with any filling. 
                  However, a traditional Australian pie should be hand-sized, filled with mincemeat 
                  and gravy, and topped with tomato sauce. A gourmet version with mashed potato and 
                  mushy peas is also popular, but any other variant surely falls under a different 
                  category.

                In 2019, the overall winner of the Great Aussie Pie Competition was the Pinjarra 
                Balery in Pinjarra, WA.
                
                </p>

  <li style="font-weight: 700; font-size: 22px;color: white;">Pumpkin Pie</li>
              <p>Australian food isn’t all about grilled meats and seafood. There are a wide range of 
                  vegetarian dishes out there too, including a hearty bowl of pumpkin soup. Best served 
                  in the colder months, and easiest to find when you head south, there’s something 
                  incredibly satisfying about a bowl of pumpkin soup eaten by the fire. Add a Granny 
                  Smith apple, which were first grown just outside of Sydney, for an authentic 
                  Australian version.</p>  

  <li style="font-weight: 700; font-size: 22px;color: white;">The Fairy Pools</li>
            <p>It is a Two-hour drive from Brisbane. The Fairy Pools, set within Noosa National Park on 
              Queensland's Sunshine Coast, are natural tidal pools surrounded by dark and dramatic 
              basalt rocks. The pools are home to a variety of coral and sponges that can be spotted 
              at low tide. Take a walk along the Coastal Track through the beautiful Noosa National 
              Park. </p>

  <li style="font-weight: 700; font-size: 22px; color: white;">Grilled Kangaroo</li>
              <p>Lean and tasty, kangaroo is one of the healthiest meats around, as well being a 
                  national icon. But you better like your steak blue, or at least rare as Kangaroo 
                  is notoriously difficult to cook and can dry out quite easily if left on the barbie 
                  too long.

                Tastewise, this Australian food is closest to beef. However, kangaroo has more 
                protein and iron than beef, and fewer calories and fat content. It’s also a good 
                source of omega-3.</p>

  <li style="font-weight: 1000; font-size: 30px; color:whitesmoke">Bonus Mention</li>
                <p>Another Aussie sweet to try is Cherry Ripe. Made by Cadbury, but only sold in 
                    Australia, this chocolate bar is similar to a Bounty Bar. It includes cherries 
                    mixed in with the coconut and is dipped in dark chocolate instead of milk 
                    chocolate.</p>
