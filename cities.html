<ol>
  <li style="font-weight: 700; font-size: 22px; color: white;">Sydney</li>
      <p>The crown jewel of what Australia has to offer, Sydney´s iconic look makes it the prime 
          destination to visit when heading Down Under. The Opera House and Sydney Harbor Bridge are 
          the undoubted postcard image of the city, although sweeping Bondi beach and the 
          picture-perfect harbor front are equally dazzling to behold.

        A lively city, Sydney has a vibrant cultural and arts scene, which makes it great to 
        live in as well as visit. With over two hundred years of history, there are some lovely 
        historic sites to visit, while just outside Sydney lie some gorgeous national parks. 
        Loud, in your face, and proud of it, Sydney is a fun, exciting city to visit that doesn´t 
        take itself all too seriously.</p>

  <li style=" font-weight: 700; font-size: 22px;color: white;">Melbourne</li>
        <p>The second largest city in the country is a stylish, cosmopolitan place to visit, with a 
            lot to see and do. One of the best cities to live in the world, Melbourne has a European 
            appearance, belying the fact that it is home to citizens of countless countries from around 
            the world – this is what gives it its unique, multicultural feel.

            Often seen as the cultural capital of the country, it has numerous art galleries, a vibrant 
            music scene, and some fantastic cuisine from around the globe. Although it can´t compare 
            with Sydney in terms of stunning sights, Melbourne wins hands-down when it comes to its 
            authentic, diverse and lively neighborhoods dotting the area. Take the time to explore 
            its streets and you´ll soon find yourself falling in love with this great city.</p>

  <li style=" font-weight: 700; font-size: 22px;color: white;">Cairns</li>
          <p>Surrounded by rainforest, the city of Cairns is geared to one thing and one thing only – 
              tourists. Consequently, upon your arrival, you will find hordes of tourists in a friendly 
              city with a laidback vibe and not much in the way of sights.

            Cairns is blessed, however, when it comes to incredible natural wonders – the spectacular 
            Great Barrier Reef is the main reason people visit the city. This stupendous natural 
            attraction is easily visited by boat, and there are also a couple of islands that you 
            can stop off at. Many people use it as a gateway to the region and Daintree National Park 
            and the Queensland Outback aren´t too far away.</p>

  <li style="font-weight: 700; font-size: 22px;color: white;">Adelaide</li>
            <p>Known as ´the city of churches´, residents of Adelaide argue that there are actually more 
                pubs than church spires in the city! This attitude highlights the laidback and casual feel
                 of the place, and there are stacks of attractive restaurants and live music venues to 
                 check out.

                Built on the banks of the Torrens River, it is a picturesque city with lots of leafy, 
                green spaces to explore. Situated in the middle of the wine regions in South Australia, 
                make sure to try a couple of local wines before you leave.
                
                With numerous museums and galleries, and the Belair National Park nearby, there´s always 
                something to do in Adelaide. One of the best times of year to visit is in ´Mad March,´ 
                when plenty of festivals and events are held concurrently.</p>

  <li style="font-weight: 700; font-size: 22px;color: white;">Brisbane</li>
              <p>The third largest city in Australia, Brisbane is the capital of the Sunshine State, 
                  and as such, it is blessed with a delightful climate throughout the year. 
                  Consequently, there are an endless number of outdoor activities to get your 
                  blood pumping. Ranging from kayaking and climbing to hiking and biking, there’s no reason to be a 
                  couch potato in Brisbane. Located on the banks of the Brisbane River, restaurants, 
                  bars, music venues and more spread out from the waterfront. It´s a vibrant and dynamic 
                  city full of positivity about what the future holds. It’s also now one of the music 
                  capitals of the world, thanks to its talented local Australian music scene.</p>

  <li style="font-weight: 700; font-size: 22px;color: white;">Perth</li>
              <p>The laidback, youthful capital of Western Australia is the perfect place to visit if 
                  you´re looking to sit back and relax for a bit. With lovely beaches, amazing weather, 
                  and a cosmopolitan feel to it, Perth is a city to savor and enjoy. It has a wealth of 
                  bars, restaurants and cultural sites, as well as loads of outdoor activities, which 
                  attract visitors and locals alike.

                Perth is one of the most isolated cities in the world – if you visit, you´re going to 
                want to spend a good amount of time there to make the journey worthwhile. Lucky for you 
                then that it´s a lovely place to be. </p>  

  <li style="font-weight: 700; font-size: 22px;color: white;">Canberra</li>
            <p>The capital of Australia is a planned city that is slowly growing into a fantastic place 
                to spend some time. Originally inhabited by politicians and civil servants, the young 
                city now has numerous museums, galleries and monuments to explore.

                Thanks in part to the large student body, there is a lively nightlife scene and a 
                plethora of restaurants and bars to choose from. Located out in the bush, Canberra 
                has lots of quality outdoor activities for you to sink your teeth into, with many 
                visitors electing to stop by the nearby Namadgi National Park.</p>

  <li style="font-weight: 700; font-size: 22px; color: white;">Darwin</li>
              <p>A cosmopolitan city, Darwin´s small stature belies the fact that it has a rich cultural 
                  heritage unique to Australia. Comprising citizens of over fifty nationalities, it is a 
                  multicultural place with an eclectic mix of Asian and Aboriginal influences.

                This is what makes it so fascinating to visit. A laidback city on the coast of the Timor 
                Sea in of Northern Territory, many people stop at Darwin and use it as a base to explore 
                the nearby natural wonders of Kakadu and Litchfield National Parks, as well as the 
                impressive Tiwi Islands.</p>

  <li style="font-weight: 700; font-size: 22px; color: white;">Hobart</li>
                <p>With a bustling waterfront lined with things to see and do, a beautiful mountain 
                    forming a backdrop to the city, and the dark blue of the ocean surrounding the 
                    shore, Hobart is definitely a picturesque place to visit.

                    The southernmost city in the country, Hobart´s remote location on the island of 
                    Tasmania ironically helped to preserve its historic buildings and Victorian 
                    architecture – primarily because it was overlooked for so long. Now, the good 
                    times are back, with Hobart welcoming more and more people to its shores each year, 
                    thanks to its wealth of attractions and captivating buzz.</p>
