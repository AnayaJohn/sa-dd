<div class="Introduction">
<p>Thinking about visiting Australia? You came to the right website. This Website allows you to not 
  only learn a lot more about Australia but gives you the most Popular cities and natural Wonders to 
  visit. Below you can see some fascinating facts about Australia.</p>
</div>

<ol>
  <li style="font-weight: 700; font-size: 22px; color: white;">The Australian Alps get more snow than the Swiss Alps</li>
      <p>While many people visit Australia for its brilliant beaches and year-round sunshine, 
        the Australian Alps, straddling New South Wales and Victoria, are a mecca for skiing 
        enthusiasts. Snow usually falls between June and September, meaning Australia is the 
        perfect place to get your skiing fix during the northern hemisphere summer.

        Thredbo and Perisher are two large resorts near Canberra, the latter being the largest ski 
        resort in the southern hemisphere. Blue Cow Mountain is one of the most popular areas, with
        a vast range of accommodation and runs as well as stunning views across the Alps.</p>

  <li style=" font-weight: 700; font-size: 22px;color: white;">Tasmania has the cleanest air in the world</li>
        <p>The island of Tasmania is the ideal spot to experience the great outdoors - with air as clean 
          a, around one-third of the state is a national park or World Heritage protected. It is a walkers 
          paradise, with trails and walkways winding over the whole island, where the coastal paths reveal 
          impressive views over Wineglass Bay and the Bay of Fires.

          If walking isn't your cup of tea, enjoy kayaking, mountain biking and exploring the island's caves. 
          The wildlife is an extension of the unique animals of Australia, where the Eastern Quoll, now 
          considered extinct on the mainland are commonly sighted in the fertile farmland of Tasmania.</p>

  <li style=" font-weight: 700; font-size: 22px;color: white;">The Great Ocean Road is the worldâ€™s largest war memorial</li>
          <p>The Great Ocean Road is one of the most famous drives in Australia, with stunning views and 
            scenic vistas along the route. Built by returning soldiers after World War One, the road was 
            dedicated as a memorial to those who died fighting and was designed to connect the isolated 
            communities that clung to the edge of Victoria's rugged coastline.</p>

  <li style="font-weight: 700; font-size: 22px;color: white;">2.5 km of Uluru is underground</li>
            <p>The vast rock of Uluru sits in the red centre of Australia, surrounded by scrubland and 
              sacred to various Aboriginal tribes in the area. It is one of the few places on the earth 
              to be listed twice as a UNESCO World Heritage site, both on the cultural and natural lists. 
              Amazingly around 2.5km of the rock is thought to be underground connected to the Olgas, where the 
              rock emerges again 16 miles away. 
            
              Experiencing Uluru at sunset is the best way to appreciate its stark beauty and after dark, 
              the pitch-black skies reveal a multitude of sparkling stars. It is easy to visit Uluru from 
              Alice Springs, reachable by plane or as a stop on the Ghan, the railway from Adelaide to 
              Darwin.</p>
  <li style="font-weight: 700; font-size: 22px;color: white;">Fraser Island is the largest sand island in the world</li>
              <p>The sandy shores of Fraser Island are a highlight of any trip to Queensland. Hervey Bay 
                is the jumping-off point for exploring the island, so hop on a boat and discover the 
                delights of this island paradise - the clear blue waters of Lake MacKenzie surrounded 
                by the white sand shore and the serenity of Champagne Pools, where you can swim in the 
                shallow pools at the edge of the ocean. There are 150 dingoes on the island so it is a 
                great opportunity to spot one of Australia's famous wild dogs but keep your distance as 
                they are wild animals and can be aggressive if approached. </p>

  <li style="font-weight: 700; font-size: 22px;color: white;">Australia has over 60 separate wine regions</li>
              <p>You can't go to Australia and not try the wine! With such a huge variety of wine regions, 
                it's hard to choose between them.  The majority of the wine regions are in New South Wales 
                and Victoria so if you fancy discovering a few of them a road trip between Sydney and 
                Melbourne would be a great way to go about it.  Take your time to explore the Southern 
                Highlands, Tumbarumba and Alpine Valleys, one of the most picturesque wine regions in 
                Australia, yielding wine from a variety of grapes, from Sauvignon Vert to Chardonnay. 
                Western Australia also has a number of vineyards that are all reachable from Perth, a 
                great trip out of the city to enjoy the wine regions of Australia. </p>  

  <li style="font-weight: 700; font-size: 22px;color: white;">The Great Barrier Reef is the largest eco-system in 
    the world</li>
            <p>The Great Barrier Reef is the pride and joy of Australia, made up of nearly 2,500 
              individual reefs and visible from space. It stretched halfway down the eastern coast 
              of the country, meaning there are plenty of places to use as jumping-off points to 
              explore the kaleidoscopic coral. Cairns is the most famous city to begin a trip out 
              to the reef but Townsville, Port Douglas and Airlie Beach all have great beaches and 
              various tours that can take you out to enjoy the reef. Snorkelling and diving amongst 
              the colourful fish and turtles that make the Great Barrier Reef their home is sure to 
              be a highlight of any trip to Australia. </p>

  <li style="font-weight: 700; font-size: 22px; color: white;">90% of Australians live on the coast</li>
              <p>The large deserts of central Australia mean that the vast majority of the population 
                live on the shores of this enormous country. The large cities of Perth, Sydney and 
                Melbourne are iconic places to visit, with buzzing centres and a multitude of beaches, 
                from the sands of Bondi to the surf of Trigg. Outside of the major hubs, there are 
                hundreds of smaller beach towns where you can appreciate Australia's beautiful coastline.

                Explore Port Macquarie in New South Wales and catch your own dinner or head up to 
                Queensland and discover the parties of Airlie Beach. Australia's island status means 
                that there are thousands of surf towns and beaches to be found, so follow the masses 
                and head to the coast.</p>

  <li style="font-weight: 700; font-size: 22px; color: white;">80% of the animals are unique to Australia</li>
                <p>The animals of Australia are some of the most interesting in the world, from cuddly 
                  marsupials to a huge variety of birds. There are so many opportunities to experience 
                  the wildlife of the country, from zoos and parks to spotting these unique creatures 
                  in the wild.
                
                  It is easy to spot kangaroos in the fields and farmland of New South Wales but 
                  koalas and platypuses are a little more elusive so if you want to see them in 
                  the wild, having a guide show you the spots where they often hide can be very useful. 
                  Sydney Wildlife World in the centre of the city is a great place to spot anything you 
                  miss.</p>
